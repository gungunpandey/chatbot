All rights reserved.Forward-Looking StatementsThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth forthforth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on as surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. Tomeet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers and entered into prepaidsupply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into oursupply chain may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity agreementarrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year, and we may incur inventory provisions or impairments if ourinventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.25We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into Our inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can be incorrect andcreate reductions or volatility in our revenue. In addition, the bring up of new Product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and high-quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay the start-up orfurther production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our products andtechnologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While wehave managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, andmay impair our ability ding Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or circuitboards which incorporate A100 or H100 Integrated circuits. The USG also announced new and updated licensing requirements for our products.During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100and H100-relatedproducts destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East. The additional licensing requirementswere effective immediately for shipments of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, H100, and H800S products.On October 17, 2023, theUSG announced new or updated licensing Requirements effective in which the USG does not intend to grant. We donot wish to have any advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that it is deemed to beextent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance thatthe customer will receive such a license,thatthe USG will grant such a License, or that the USGA will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed over the long-term, if there are anyfurther changes in the US G’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions acturing costs, employee wages, costsfor capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing strategy generally does not fluctuate with short-term or long-termchanges in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.Israel ConflictWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our employees. We haveapproximately 3,400 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking andnetworking products. Our operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impactedemployees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain latforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate a wide range ofprocessors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services, and provide a broad range ofservices to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization,Visualization, and Automotive.Data CenterRevenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $18.12 billion, up 206% from a year ago and up 34% sequentially. Data Center revenue was up 279% froma year ago, up 41% sequential. Strong sales of the NVIDIA HGX platform were driven by globaldemand for the training and inferencing of large language Gross margin increased significantly from a year ago and sequentially, primarily due to the increase in sell-in to non-partners following normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was primarily dueto stronger enterprise workstation demand and on-demand and the ramp of notebook workstations based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture.Gross Margin IncreasesAutomotive revenue was up 4% from a Year ago and up 3% sequentially. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects growth in sales of auto-cockpit solutions and self-driving platforms. The sequentially increase was driven by increased sales of self-driver platforms. Gross margin was up 2.5 percentage points sequentially and the unfavorable effect  that the NVIDIA Spectrum-X will be integrated into servers from Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo in the first-first quarter of next year; announced that NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips will power more than 40 new supercomputers and began pre-shipping in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024; and partnered with a range of leading companies on AI initiatives, including Amdocs, Dropbox, Google Cloud Platform, Amazon.com,Foxconn, Genentech (member of Roche Group), Infosys, Lenovo, Reliance Industries, Scaleway, and Tata Group.Gaming revenue was $2.86 billion, up 81% from a year ago and up 15% from the previous quarter. d Nine Months Ended September 30,October 29, October 30, October 29,October 30,September 30,December 30, December 30,January 20,2023 2022 2023 2022 2021 2021 2021 2022 2021 2022 2022 2022 2021Revenue 100.0 % 100.5 % 100,0 %100.0%Cost of revenue 26.0 46.4 29.1 44.9 46.9Gross profit 74.0 53.6 70.9 55.1 46.8Operating expenses:Research and development 12.7 32.8 16.0 25.7 26.7 27.9Sales, general and administrative 3.8 10.6 5.0 8.7 28.9 26. third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the third quarter of Fiscal year 2023 reflects growth in Gaming GPUs, partially offset byreflecting higher sell-in to partners following normalization of channel inventory levels earlier this year. The decrease in the first nine months of fiscalyear 2024 comparedto thefirst nine monthsoffiscal year 2024, compared tothe first ninemonths of fiscal fiscal year 2019, primarily reflects 57% lower enterprise graphics and 14% lower sales to customers outside of the United States.The increase in revenue was primarily driven by growth inProfessional Visualization GPUs, fully offset by 7% growth in Computing GPUs, and 5% increase in ComputingGPUs, partially in response to the normalizing channel inventory level earlier thisyear. ely 15% and 17.17% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. A second End Customer is estimated to have a market share of approximately 15%.represented approximately 13% and 10% of the total revenue, respectively, in the first quarter and the first nine Months of Fiscal year 2024. Both ofthese End Customers were primarily attributable to our Compute & Networking segment. Our estimated Compute and Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain concentrated. In addition, we expect to continue to see a significant increase in the number of customers with 10% or more of our total revenue.In the first six months of our fiscal year 2023, there were no customers with cal year 2023, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $21 million and $59 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year2023.

Cash used in investing activities increased during the second half of fiscal 2018.Cash provided by investing activities decreased in resources, including our access to external capital markets and our ability to access externalcapital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.Except for approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any income taxes orany related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U-S., substantially all of our cash, Cash equivalents and marketables are available for use in the United States. In addition, approximately $2.1 billion of oursecurities held outside of the United. Thesesecurities are held in Canada and $2 billion ofsecurities hold outside of Canada. These securities are available in the U.-S. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee-compensation made after December 31, 2022. This provision has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper ProgramsOur aggregate debt maturities as of October 29, 2023, by year payable, are as follows:(In millions)October 29, 2018(in millions)AmountsDue in one year $ 1,250FilenameDue in two to five years $ 2,250FolderDue in five to ten years 2,750AccessoryDue in greater than ten years 3,500FilenameUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs ( debt, and purchase obligations, refer to Note 3, Note 12, and Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed and Non-Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.   $34Climate Change Affects Our Results of OperationsTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from over-sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends.   Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   The impact of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements on our financial results has not materially affected our financial performance as of October 29, 2023.   Financial Market Risk AffectsOur Financial Market RiskThere has not been no adoption of any new and nternal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP/ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, including therecords used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes in our financial reportingthat materially affect our internal control overfinancial reporting.PART II. INherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and ProceduresOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, and/or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all ed April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2018, and below.Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and in Item 2A of the Annual Reporton Form 20-F for the Fiscal year ended January 29, 2018 and in Items 1A and 10-Q for our Quarterly Reports on Form 2010-11, and for the quartersended March 31, 2011, and the quartersend and quarterend and yearend and the fiscal quartersended April 30.comend and ended June 30, 2016, and respectively. Additionally, any one of those onally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components from third parties that are necessary for the manufacturing processfor the finished product are not available. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced extended lead times of more than 12 months, which we have re-experienced and may continue to experience extended lead time, which has increased our product costs. We also have paid premiums and provided deposits to our existing suppliers to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our customer costs and may also continue to do so act the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies; or• the demand for our products relating to cryptocurrency mining, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and other non-generative AI models; or; or,• government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.Demand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To meet ormeet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers, and entered into prepaid-supply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, the integration of new suppliers into our pre-suppsupply transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new productintroductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for ourcurrent generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time. We may not be able to predict demand in-time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our revenue andfinancial results may be negatively impacted. In addition, the bring up of new Product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges, product design issues,and quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs parties. If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity toincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase our production and/orproduction levels to meet customer demand,we may not increase production or/or production/production levelsto meet our customers’ demand, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply/demand/supply constraints.if we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill ourCustomers’s demand for certain of ourproducts, or atall, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market purchase obligations and pre-prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively-impact our gross margins and financial results.We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist, such as NVIDIA DGX cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new and/or non-use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, or forecasted demand.New technologies such as and unexpected use cases, has impacted and/orcan in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several yearsago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable-degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future use of cryptocurrency, on demand forour products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government and non-cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has negatively impacted our ability to estimate demandfor our products.impacted and erated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as Adobe Flash Player andGeForce NOW. Failure by our customers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that are compatible with our platforms, failure by ourcustomers, developers, or other third partycontent providers or publishers to provide their content or to provide our content availableon reasonable terms or at all for use by our products or end users on ourplatforms, could adversely affect customer demand.International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business.We sell our products internationally, and we also terrorism, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, natural disasters, telecommunication ortelecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political or/or Civil unrest, act of war and other militaryactions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, andOther natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events, Our corporate headquarters, ourcorporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of nd may alsocontinue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and to othercompanies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if ourmanufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power outages, weathershortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas isunknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects e third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we did not experience any conflict that would have asignificant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and/orrevenue or create other uncertainty for our business.Additionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, includingdue to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services to our customers. These interruptions, disruptions, disruptions and other performance and quality problems may affect our services andservices and harm my business. As we increase our nges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to successfully consummate orpursue other transactions, our target company may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less orless attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our ability to grow ourbusiness. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability or predictability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in non-publicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value stment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets/assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.Additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:1• difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, vendors and customers,including key personnel, of the acquired business;2• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;3• integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;4• coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which our target operates;540• stock price impact, fines, fees challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of our sales andsales to End Customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these EndCustomers. Our sales to our customers are largely insupport of two End Customers. We have a large concentration ofOur sales and salesto our Endcustomers are primarily in support of twoEnd Customers.Our sales toOur End Customers are insupportof twoEndCustomers, and we receive a substantial portion of our revenues from our distribution and partner network. Sales toCustomer A represented 12 o have represented approximately 13% and 8.10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of these End Customers were primarily non-attributable to our Compute & Networking segment. Our estimated Compute and Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain low-to-mid-concentrated. Our customers sell to End Customers. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple channels, includingoriginal equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. If end demandincreases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrator, distributor, and channel partnersmay have our competitive position, which could negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our officers, employees,employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed anddesigned to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, ourOfficers, or our employees, and/or the termination of our contracts with our employees oremployees or prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which weare subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs r business and financial condition, andplans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or in the countries in which weplan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, and non-export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U and foreign governments, and other trade restrictions, including tariffs, export restrictions or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers andemployees, do business without an export license with in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI in the development ofapplications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the futureresult in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can beused for training, refining, and deploying large language models. Such restrictions have limited and couldIn the future limit the ability of ourdownstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy, and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and could irrenegatively impact our business and financial results. Export controls on semiconductors associated with even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitivedisadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with NVIDIA AI andwith AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, ortransfer of our product, negatively impacting demand for our products. Controls could negatively impact our ability toprovide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide services to their End Customers, even outside China. Additional export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, adversely impacting our ability of our customers to serve demand We have received numerous requests from governments, including those in China andChina, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, whichcould also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and our efforts to supply the China market, and ifthey conclude that we have violated any applicable law in China or the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition, this could adversely impact our business. Thiscould subject us to various penalties or restrictions on our Ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business andcould have amaterial and adverse-impact on the Company’s business, operating results ina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding the United States and Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L50S and RTX 4090. The non-licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding these performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements for our A100 and H100 productswere effective immediately for shipments of our A400, A600, H etitive position has been harmed, and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if:our competitive position and future financial results maybe further harmed byour competitive positioning and futureresults may beFurther harmed, including further changes in the USG’s export controls,including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if ourcustomers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the UGdoes not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if theUSGgrants any requested licenses, the licenses may be ected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, such as GeForce GTX 1080 Ti,and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distributionchain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt oursupply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of the products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. export controls on datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs,such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of third-party parties to create large clusters for frontier y, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our eGaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may negatively affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government and thegovernment may impose restrictions on the sale to certain End Customers of our products, or any products containing components made by ourpartners and suppliers. For example, in September 2017, theChinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain components andproducts made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business, including ourbusiness and financial results. We have no plans to introduce any new restrictions.44Finally, our business depends nable to develop effective internal policies and/or business-frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience adverse effects, such asbrand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI couldincrease our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain products and services. We may be unable to sell ourproducts and services in some jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.Forward-Looking StatementsThis Quarterly Report on Form ation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward‑looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update these non-statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,’ “us,“ “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.© 2023 NVIDIA Corporation. All rights reserved.Forward-Looking StatementsThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth forthforth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on as surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. Tomeet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers and entered into prepaidsupply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into oursupply chain may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity agreementarrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year, and we may incur inventory provisions or impairments if ourinventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.25We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into Our inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can be incorrect andcreate reductions or volatility in our revenue. In addition, the bring up of new Product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and high-quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay the start-up orfurther production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our products andtechnologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While wehave managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, andmay impair our ability ding Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or circuitboards which incorporate A100 or H100 Integrated circuits. The USG also announced new and updated licensing requirements for our products.During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100and H100-relatedproducts destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East. The additional licensing requirementswere effective immediately for shipments of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, H100, and H800S products.On October 17, 2023, theUSG announced new or updated licensing Requirements effective in which the USG does not intend to grant. We donot wish to have any advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that it is deemed to beextent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance thatthe customer will receive such a license,thatthe USG will grant such a License, or that the USGA will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed over the long-term, if there are anyfurther changes in the US G’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions acturing costs, employee wages, costsfor capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing strategy generally does not fluctuate with short-term or long-termchanges in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.Israel ConflictWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our employees. We haveapproximately 3,400 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking andnetworking products. Our operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impactedemployees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain latforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate a wide range ofprocessors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services, and provide a broad range ofservices to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization,Visualization, and Automotive.Data CenterRevenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $18.12 billion, up 206% from a year ago and up 34% sequentially. Data Center revenue was up 279% froma year ago, up 41% sequential. Strong sales of the NVIDIA HGX platform were driven by globaldemand for the training and inferencing of large language Gross margin increased significantly from a year ago and sequentially, primarily due to the increase in sell-in to non-partners following normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was primarily dueto stronger enterprise workstation demand and on-demand and the ramp of notebook workstations based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture.Gross Margin IncreasesAutomotive revenue was up 4% from a Year ago and up 3% sequentially. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects growth in sales of auto-cockpit solutions and self-driving platforms. The sequentially increase was driven by increased sales of self-driver platforms. Gross margin was up 2.5 percentage points sequentially and the unfavorable effect  that the NVIDIA Spectrum-X will be integrated into servers from Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo in the first-first quarter of next year; announced that NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips will power more than 40 new supercomputers and began pre-shipping in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024; and partnered with a range of leading companies on AI initiatives, including Amdocs, Dropbox, Google Cloud Platform, Amazon.com,Foxconn, Genentech (member of Roche Group), Infosys, Lenovo, Reliance Industries, Scaleway, and Tata Group.Gaming revenue was $2.86 billion, up 81% from a year ago and up 15% from the previous quarter. d Nine Months Ended September 30,October 29, October 30, October 29,October 30,September 30,December 30, December 30,January 20,2023 2022 2023 2022 2021 2021 2021 2022 2021 2022 2022 2022 2021Revenue 100.0 % 100.5 % 100,0 %100.0%Cost of revenue 26.0 46.4 29.1 44.9 46.9Gross profit 74.0 53.6 70.9 55.1 46.8Operating expenses:Research and development 12.7 32.8 16.0 25.7 26.7 27.9Sales, general and administrative 3.8 10.6 5.0 8.7 28.9 26. third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the third quarter of Fiscal year 2023 reflects growth in Gaming GPUs, partially offset byreflecting higher sell-in to partners following normalization of channel inventory levels earlier this year.

A second End Customer is estimated to have a market share of approximately 15%.represented approximately 13% and 10% of the total revenue, respectively, in the first quarter and the first nine Months of Fiscal year 2024. Both ofthese End Customers were primarily attributable to our Compute & Networking segment. Our estimated Compute and Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain concentrated. In addition, we expect to continue to see a significant increase in the number of customers with 10% or more of our total revenue.In the first six months of our fiscal year 2023, there were no customers with cal year 2023, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $21 million and $59 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year2023.

In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP/ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, including therecords used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes in our financial reportingthat materially affect our internal control overfinancial reporting.PART II. INherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and ProceduresOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, and/or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all ed April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2018, and below.Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and in Item 2A of the Annual Reporton Form 20-F for the Fiscal year ended January 29, 2018 and in Items 1A and 10-Q for our Quarterly Reports on Form 2010-11, and for the quartersended March 31, 2011, and the quartersend and quarterend and yearend and the fiscal quartersended April 30.comend and ended June 30, 2016, and respectively. Additionally, any one of those onally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components from third parties that are necessary for the manufacturing processfor the finished product are not available. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced extended lead times of more than 12 months, which we have re-experienced and may continue to experience extended lead time, which has increased our product costs. We also have paid premiums and provided deposits to our existing suppliers to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our customer costs and may also continue to do so act the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies; or• the demand for our products relating to cryptocurrency mining, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and other non-generative AI models; or; or,• government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.Demand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To meet ormeet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers, and entered into prepaid-supply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, the integration of new suppliers into our pre-suppsupply transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new productintroductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for ourcurrent generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time. We may not be able to predict demand in-time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our revenue andfinancial results may be negatively impacted. In addition, the bring up of new Product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges, product design issues,and quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs parties. If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity toincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase our production and/orproduction levels to meet customer demand,we may not increase production or/or production/production levelsto meet our customers’ demand, or our contract manufacturers may experience supply/demand/supply constraints.if we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill ourCustomers’s demand for certain of ourproducts, or atall, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market purchase obligations and pre-prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively-impact our gross margins and financial results.We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist, such as NVIDIA DGX cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new and/or non-use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, or forecasted demand.New technologies such as and unexpected use cases, has impacted and/orcan in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several yearsago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable-degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future use of cryptocurrency, on demand forour products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government and non-cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has negatively impacted our ability to estimate demandfor our products.impacted and erated computing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as Adobe Flash Player andGeForce NOW. Failure by our customers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that are compatible with our platforms, failure by ourcustomers, developers, or other third partycontent providers or publishers to provide their content or to provide our content availableon reasonable terms or at all for use by our products or end users on ourplatforms, could adversely affect customer demand.International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business.We sell our products internationally, and we also terrorism, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, natural disasters, telecommunication ortelecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political or/or Civil unrest, act of war and other militaryactions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, andOther natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events, Our corporate headquarters, ourcorporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of nd may alsocontinue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and to othercompanies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if ourmanufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power outages, weathershortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas isunknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects e third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we did not experience any conflict that would have asignificant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and/orrevenue or create other uncertainty for our business.Additionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, includingdue to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and services to our customers. These interruptions, disruptions, disruptions and other performance and quality problems may affect our services andservices and harm my business. As we increase our nges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to successfully consummate orpursue other transactions, our target company may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition less orless attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our ability to grow ourbusiness. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability or predictability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in non-publicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value stment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets/assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.Additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:1• difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, vendors and customers,including key personnel, of the acquired business;2• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;3• integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;4• coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which our target operates;540• stock price impact, fines, fees challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of our sales andsales to End Customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these EndCustomers. Our sales to our customers are largely insupport of two End Customers. We have a large concentration ofOur sales and salesto our Endcustomers are primarily in support of twoEnd Customers.Our sales toOur End Customers are insupportof twoEndCustomers, and we receive a substantial portion of our revenues from our distribution and partner network. Sales toCustomer A represented 12 o have represented approximately 13% and 8.10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of these End Customers were primarily non-attributable to our Compute & Networking segment. Our estimated Compute and Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain low-to-mid-concentrated. Our customers sell to End Customers. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple channels, includingoriginal equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. If end demandincreases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrator, distributor, and channel partnersmay have our competitive position, which could negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our officers, employees,employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed anddesigned to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, ourOfficers, or our employees, and/or the termination of our contracts with our employees oremployees or prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which weare subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs r business and financial condition, andplans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or in the countries in which weplan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, and non-export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U and foreign governments, and other trade restrictions, including tariffs, export restrictions or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers andemployees, do business without an export license with in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and service offerings.Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI in the development ofapplications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the futureresult in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can beused for training, refining, and deploying large language models. Such restrictions have limited and couldIn the future limit the ability of ourdownstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy, and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and could irrenegatively impact our business and financial results. Export controls on semiconductors associated with even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitivedisadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with NVIDIA AI andwith AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, ortransfer of our product, negatively impacting demand for our products. Controls could negatively impact our ability toprovide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to provide services to their End Customers, even outside China. Additional export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, adversely impacting our ability of our customers to serve demand We have received numerous requests from governments, including those in China andChina, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, whichcould also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and our efforts to supply the China market, and ifthey conclude that we have violated any applicable law in China or the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition, this could adversely impact our business. Thiscould subject us to various penalties or restrictions on our Ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business andcould have amaterial and adverse-impact on the Company’s business, operating results ina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding the United States and Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L50S and RTX 4090. The non-licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding these performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements for our A100 and H100 productswere effective immediately for shipments of our A400, A600, H etitive position has been harmed, and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if:our competitive position and future financial results maybe further harmed byour competitive positioning and futureresults may beFurther harmed, including further changes in the USG’s export controls,including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if ourcustomers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the UGdoes not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if theUSGgrants any requested licenses, the licenses may be ected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, such as GeForce GTX 1080 Ti,and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distributionchain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt oursupply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of the products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. export controls on datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs,such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of third-party parties to create large clusters for frontier y, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our eGaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may negatively affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government and thegovernment may impose restrictions on the sale to certain End Customers of our products, or any products containing components made by ourpartners and suppliers. For example, in September 2017, theChinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain components andproducts made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our business, including ourbusiness and financial results. We have no plans to introduce any new restrictions.44Finally, our business depends nable to develop effective internal policies and/or business-frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience adverse effects, such asbrand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI couldincrease our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain products and services. We may be unable to sell ourproducts and services in some jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with government regulation of AI, includingunder proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union as well as under any U.S  billion, without expiration. As of October 29, 2023, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional oradditional shares of our common stock up to $25.24 billion.The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in structured multi-share repurchase programs, and can be make in one or more larger repurchased, in compliance with Rule10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subjectto market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors.
