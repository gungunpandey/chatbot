STATEMENTS\\n(Unaudited)\\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\\naccepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 29, 2023 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited\\nconsolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, as filed with the SEC,\\nbut does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring\\nadjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the\\ninterim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in\\nconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\\nended January 29, 2023. \\nSignificant Accounting Policies\\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant\\nAccounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\\nJanuary 29, 2023.\\nFiscal Year\\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 are both 52-week years. The third\\nquarters of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were both 13-week quarters.\\nReclassifications\\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All\\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going\\nbasis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\\nreceivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other\\ncharges, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions\\nthat we believe are reasonable.\\nIn February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and\\nusage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to a range of four to\\nfive years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to seven years. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning\\nof fiscal year 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net, in use\\nas of the end of fiscal year 2023, the estimated effect of this change for the three months ended October 29, 2023 was a benefit of $17 million\\nand $24 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $41 million and\\nnet income of $36 million after tax, or $0.01 per both basic and diluted share. The estimated effect of this change for the first nine months of\\nfiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $24 million and $83 million\\n9\\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\n(Unaudited)\\nfor cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $107 million and net income of\\n$91 million after tax, or $0.04 per both basic and diluted share.\\nNote 2 - Business Combination\\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby\\nNVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited, or Arm, from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate due to significant regulatory challenges\\npreventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-\\noff of the prepayment provided at signing.\\nNote 3 - Leases\\nOur lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data\\ncenter space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2024 and 2035.\\nFuture minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of October 29, 2023 are as follows:\\nOperating Lease\\nObligations\\n \\n(In millions)\\nFiscal Year:\\n \\n2024 (excluding first nine months of fiscal year 2024)\\n$\\n84 \\n2025\\n269 \\n2026\\n248 \\n2027\\n233 \\n2028\\n220 \\n2029 and thereafter\\n454 \\nTotal\\n1,508 \\nLess imputed interest\\n187 \\nPresent value of net future minimum lease payments\\n1,321 \\nLess short-term operating lease liabilities\\n230 \\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\\n$\\n1,091 \\nIn addition, we have operating leases, primarily for our data centers, that are expected to commence between the fourth quarter of fiscal year\\n2024 and fiscal year 2025 with lease terms of 3 to 10 years for $924 million.\\nOperating lease expenses were $69 million and $49 million for the third quarter of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $195 million and\\n$139 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Income tax as a percentage of\\nincome before income tax was an expense of 12.2% and 11.3% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and a\\nbenefit of 10.9% and 2.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively.\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2018\\nand 2019 was resolved. We recognized a non-cash net benefit of $145  million, related to this IRS audit resolution, for effectively settled\\npositions. This benefit consists of a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of\\nfederal benefit partially offset by additional cash tax payments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.\\nThe effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based\\ncompensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax\\nrate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.\\nOur effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax\\nbenefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our effective\\ntax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the IRS audit resolution.\\n12\\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\n(Unaudited)\\nOther than the IRS audit resolution, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, there were no material changes to our tax years that remain\\nsubject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. Additionally, there have been no other material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and\\nany related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023.\\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not\\nthat the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.\\nAccordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are\\nmade or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of October 29, 2023, we do not believe\\nthat our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\\nNote 7 - Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities \\nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities are classified as “available-for-sale” debt securities.\\nThe following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities:\\n \\nOctober 29, 2023\\nAmortized\\nCost\\nUnrealized\\nGain\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nEstimated\\nFair Value\\nReported as\\n \\nCash\\nEquivalents\\nMarketable\\nSecurities\\n \\n(In millions)\\nCorporate debt securities\\n$\\n6,937 \\n$\\n1 \\n$\\n(20)\\n$\\n6,918 \\n$\\n1,714 \\n$\\n5,204 \\nDebt securities issued by the U.S.\\nTreasury\\n5,075 \\n1 \\n(24)\\n5,052 \\n— \\n5,052 \\nMoney market funds\\n3,190 \\n— \\n— \\n3,190 \\n3,190 \\n— \\nDebt securities issued by U.S.\\ngovernment agencies\\n2,316 \\n— \\n(5)\\n2,311 \\n100 \\n2,211 \\nCertificates of deposit\\n418 \\n— \\n— \\n418 \\n198 \\n220 \\nForeign government bonds\\n175 \\n— \\n— \\n175 \\n100 \\n75 \\nTotal\\n$\\n18,111 \\n$\\n2 \\n$\\n(49)\\n$\\n18,064 \\n$\\n5,302 \\n$\\n12,762 \\n \\nJanuary 29, 2023\\nAmortized\\nCost\\nUnrealized\\nGain\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nEstimated\\nFair Value\\nReported as\\n \\nCash\\nEquivalents\\nMarketable\\nSecurities\\n \\n(In millions)\\nCorporate debt securities\\n$\\n4,809 \\n$\\n— \\n$\\n(12)\\n$\\n4,797 \\n$\\n1,087 \\n$\\n3,710 \\nDebt securities issued by the U.S.\\nTreasury\\n4,185 \\n1 \\n(44)\\n4,142 \\n— \\n4,142 \\nDebt securities issued by U.S.\\ngovernment agencies\\n1,836 \\n— \\n(2)\\n1,834 \\n50 \\n1,784 \\nMoney market funds\\n1,777 \\n— \\n— \\n1,777 \\n1,777 \\n— \\nCertificates of deposit\\n365 \\n— \\n— \\n365 \\n134 \\n231 \\nForeign government bonds\\n140 \\n— \\n— \\n140 \\n100 \\n40 \\nTotal\\n$\\n13,112 \\n$\\n1 \\n$\\n(58)\\n$\\n13,055 \\n$\\n3,148 \\n$\\n9,907 \\n13\\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\n(Unaudited)\\nThe following tables provide the breakdown of unrealized losses, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities\\nhave been in a continuous loss position:\\nOctober 29, 2023\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nEstimated Fair\\nValue\\nGross\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nEstimated Fair\\nValue\\nGross\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nEstimated Fair\\nValue\\nGross\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\n \\n(In millions)\\nCorporate debt securities\\n$\\n2,773 \\n$\\n(16)\\n$\\n852 \\n$\\n(4)\\n$\\n3,625  $\\n(20)\\nDebt securities issued by the U.S.\\nTreasury\\n2,098 \\n(12)\\n1,371 \\n(12)\\n3,469 \\n(24)\\nDebt securities issued by U.S.\\ngovernment agencies\\n1,447 \\n(5)\\n— \\n— \\n1,447 \\n(5)\\nTotal\\n$\\n6,318 \\n$\\n(33)\\n$\\n2,223 \\n$\\n(16)\\n$\\n8,541  $\\n(49)\\nJanuary 29, 2023\\n \\nLess than 12 Months\\n12 Months or Greater\\nTotal\\n \\nEstimated Fair\\nValue\\nGross\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nEstimated Fair\\nValue\\nGross\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\nEstimated Fair\\nValue\\nGross\\nUnrealized\\nLoss\\n \\n(In millions)\\nDebt securities issued by the U.S.\\nTreasury\\n$\\n2,444 \\n$\\n(21)\\n$\\n1,172 \\n$\\n(23)\\n$\\n3,616  $\\n(44)\\nCorporate debt securities\\n1,188 \\n(7)\\n696 \\n(5)\\n1,884 \\n(12)\\nDebt securities issued by U.S.\\ngovernment agencies\\n1,307 \\n(2)\\n— \\n— \\n1,307 \\n(2)\\nTotal\\n$\\n4,939 \\n$\\n(30)\\n$\\n1,868 \\n$\\n(28)\\n$\\n6,807  $\\n(58)\\nThe gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, driven primarily by changes in interest rates.

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities\\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also\\nalleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class\\ncertification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert\\nfees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the\\ncomplaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from\\njudgment\\n20\\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\n(Unaudited)\\nin the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit\\npanel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district\\ncourt did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth\\nCircuit panel’s majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023.\\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG,\\ninitially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the\\nplaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case,\\nbut stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. Following the\\nNinth Circuit’s denial of NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the parties will meet and confer regarding the next steps in this\\nderivative matter. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of\\nfiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the\\ndissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU\\ndemand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance\\nand internal procedures.\\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,\\nLipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending\\nresolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. Following the Ninth Circuit’s denial of NVIDIA’s\\npetition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the parties will meet and confer regarding the next steps in these derivative matters. The lawsuits\\nassert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,\\ninsider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on\\nthe dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU\\ndemand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and\\nunspecified corporate governance measures.\\nAnother putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang,\\net al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the\\nCompany for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to\\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including\\ndisgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures.\\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\\nAs of October 29, 2023, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based\\non our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in\\nthese matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

All rights reserved.\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set\\nforth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, and our Quarterly\\nReports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023 under the heading “Risk Factors” of such reports, and our\\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere\\nin this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to purchase or sell shares of our common stock.\\nOverview\\nOur Company and Our Businesses\\nSince our founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 has sparked the growth of\\nthe PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and has fueled industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA\\nis now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.\\nOur two operating segments are \\\"Compute \u0026 Networking\\\" and \\\"Graphics,\\\" as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements.\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\\nDemand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To\\nmeet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers and entered into prepaid\\nsupply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into our\\nsupply chain may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity\\narrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\n25\\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity\\ncommitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand\\nexpectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles or enter new lines of business, which may\\nrequire us to integrate new suppliers into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity.\\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\\nprepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the\\narchitecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch\\ncadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges\\nassociated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers\\nanticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can\\ncreate reductions or volatility in our revenue. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and\\nquality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay\\nfurther production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our\\ntechnologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we\\nhave managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,\\nmay impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist such as our Omniverse platform, third-\\nparty large language models, and generative AI models. We have recently begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX cloud services\\ndirectly and through our network of partners, which includes cloud-based infrastructure and software and services for training and deploying AI\\nmodels, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for customizable pretrained AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services\\ncan be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use\\ncases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand\\nfor Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown.\\nGlobal Trade\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions,\\nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or\\nboards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100\\nproducts destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nOn October 17, 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports\\nto China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding\\nIsrael) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an\\nultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements\\nwere effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. These licensing requirements did not have a\\nmeaningful impact on our revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 as they were announced near the end of the fiscal quarter and we had\\nadditional demand from customers outside of the named country groups. Our sales to China and other affected destinations, derived from\\nproducts that are now subject to licensing requirements, have consistently contributed approximately 20-25% of Data Center revenue over the\\npast few quarters. We expect that our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, though we\\nbelieve the decline will be more than offset by strong growth in other regions.\\nWe are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new regulation-compliant solutions, including those for which the USG does\\nnot wish to have any advance notice before each shipment. To the\\n26\\nextent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance\\nthat the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed over the long-term, if there are\\nfurther changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has\\nchanged and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and\\nlicensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our\\ninventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding\\nus from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. Our sales to China will decrease\\nsignificantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024.\\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific, including\\nChina, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative\\nmanufacturing locations and negatively impact our business.\\nMacroeconomic Factors\\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic\\nand geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While\\ndifficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs\\nfor capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing strategy generally does not fluctuate with short-term\\nchanges in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors. \\nIsrael\\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our\\napproximately 3,400 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our\\nnetworking products. Our operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted\\nemployees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact.\\nFurther, in connection with the conflict, a significant number and percentage of our employees have been called-up for active military duty in\\nIsrael. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel may be absent for an extended and indeterminate period, which may cause disruption to our\\nproduct development or operations. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we did not experience any significant impact or expense to our\\nbusiness; however, if the conflict is extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for\\nour business.\\nThird Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Summary\\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nOctober 29,\\n2023\\nJuly 30, 2023\\nOctober 30,\\n2022\\nQuarter-over-Quarter\\nChange\\nYear-over-Year\\nChange\\n($ in millions, except per share data)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n18,120 \\n$\\n13,507 \\n$\\n5,931 \\n34 %\\n206 %\\nGross margin\\n74.0 %\\n70.1 %\\n53.6 %\\n3.9 pts\\n20.4 pts\\nOperating expenses\\n$\\n2,983 \\n$\\n2,662 \\n$\\n2,576 \\n12 %\\n16 %\\nOperating income\\n$\\n10,417 \\n$\\n6,800 \\n$\\n601 \\n53 %\\n1,633 %\\nNet income\\n$\\n9,243 \\n$\\n6,188 \\n$\\n680 \\n49 %\\n1,259 %\\nNet income per diluted share\\n$\\n3.71 \\n$\\n2.48 \\n$\\n0.27 \\n50 %\\n1,274 %\\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications.

Strong sales of the NVIDIA HGX platform were driven by global\\ndemand for the training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Data Center\\ncompute grew 324% from a year ago and 38% sequentially, largely reflecting the strong ramp of our Hopper GPU architecture-based HGX\\nplatform from cloud service providers, or CSPs, including GPU-specialized CSPs; consumer internet companies; and enterprises. Our sales of\\nAmpere GPU architecture-based Data Center products were significant but declined sequentially, as we approach the tail end of this\\narchitecture. We recognized initial revenue on the ramp of our L40S GPU and the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip for a broad range of\\ncustomers. CSPs drove roughly half of Data Center revenue, while consumer internet companies and enterprises comprised approximately the\\nother half. Networking was up 155% from a year ago and up 52% sequentially, almost entirely due to strong growth in InfiniBand infrastructure to\\nsupport our HGX platform.\\nGaming revenue was up 81% from a year ago and up 15% sequentially. Strong year-on-year growth reflects higher sell-in to partners following\\nnormalization of channel inventory levels. Sequential growth reflects strong demand for our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for back-to-school\\nand the start of the holiday season.\\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 108% from a year ago and up 10% sequentially. The year-on-year increase reflects higher sell-in to\\npartners following normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was primarily due to stronger enterprise workstation\\ndemand and the ramp of notebook workstations based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture.\\nAutomotive revenue was up 4% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects growth in sales of auto\\ncockpit solutions and self-driving platforms. The sequential increase was driven by sales of self-driving platforms.\\nGross margin increased significantly from a year ago and sequentially, driven by improved product mix from Data Center revenue growth and\\nlower net inventory provisions and related charges.\\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, provisions for inventory and related charges were $681 million. Sales of previously reserved inventory or\\nsettlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $239 million, primarily from Ampere GPU architecture\\nproducts. The net inventory provisions were $442 million and the unfavorable effect on our gross margin was 2.4 percentage points.\\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, provisions for inventory and related charges were $702 million. Sales of previously reserved inventory or\\nsettlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $21 million. The net inventory provisions were $681\\nmillion and the unfavorable effect on our gross margin was 11.5 percentage points.\\nOperating expenses were up 16% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially, driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based\\ncompensation, primarily reflecting growth in employees and compensation increases.\\nMarket Platform Highlights\\nData Center revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $14.51 billion, up 279% from a year ago and up 41% from the previous quarter.\\nWe announced NVIDIA HGX H200 with the H200 Tensor Core GPU; introduced an AI foundry service, first available on Microsoft Azure;\\nannounced that the NVIDIA Spectrum-X will be integrated into servers from Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo in the\\nfirst quarter of next year; announced that NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips will power more than 40 new supercomputers and began\\nshipping in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024; and partnered with a range of leading companies on AI initiatives, including Amdocs, Dropbox,\\nFoxconn, Genentech (member of Roche Group), Infosys, Lenovo, Reliance Industries, Scaleway, and Tata Group.\\nGaming revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $2.86 billion, up 81% from a year ago and up 15% from the previous quarter.

Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple original\\nequipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. Our sales to Customer A\\nand Customer B were largely in support of two End Customers. One End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 15% and\\n17% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. A second End Customer is estimated to have\\nrepresented approximately 13% and 10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of\\nthese End Customers were primarily attributable to our Compute \u0026 Networking segment.\\nOur estimated Compute \u0026 Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain concentrated.\\nIn the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, there were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023,\\none customer represented 10% of total revenue, primarily attributable to the Compute \u0026 Networking segment.\\nGross Margin\\nOur overall gross margin increased to 74.0% and 70.9% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, from 53.6%\\nand 55.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023,\\n30\\nrespectively.

Our marketable securities consist of debt\\nsecurities issued by the USG and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as\\ncertificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to\\nNote 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to\\nmeet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our debt obligations, future supply\\nobligations and vendor and supplier prepayments. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external\\ncapital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\\nExcept for approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued\\nany related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable\\nsecurities held outside of the U.S. as of October 29, 2023 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\\nWe\\n33\\npaid $4.35 billion in cash taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, largely for previously deferred federal income tax payments related to the\\ndisaster relief made available by the IRS for certain California taxpayers.\\nCapital Return to Shareholders\\nDuring the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we returned $3.72 billion and $7.01 billion, respectively, in share repurchases\\nand $99 million and $296 million, respectively, in cash dividends.\\nOur cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to the continuing determination by our\\nBoard of Directors that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\\nOn August 21, 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.00 billion, without\\nexpiration.

From October 30, 2023 through November 17, 2023, we repurchased 0.8 million shares for $366 million pursuant to a Rule\\n10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share\\nrepurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.\\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee\\ncompensation made after December 31, 2022. This provision has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper\\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of October 29, 2023, by year payable, are as follows:\\n \\nOctober 29, 2023\\n \\n(In millions)\\nDue in one year\\n$\\n1,250 \\nDue in one to five years\\n2,250 \\nDue in five to ten years\\n2,750 \\nDue in greater than ten years\\n3,500 \\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs\\n(44)\\nNet carrying amount\\n9,706 \\nLess short-term portion\\n(1,249)\\nTotal long-term portion\\n$\\n8,457 \\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.

We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties\\nin individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.\\nRefer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\\nOther than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our\\ncontractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. Refer to Item 7,\\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our\\noperating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations, refer to Note 3, Note 12, and Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed\\nConsolidated Financial Statements, respectively.\\n34\\nClimate Change\\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from\\nsourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends.\\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\\nThere has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.\\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\\nFinancial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\\nAbout Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of October 29, 2023, there have been no\\nmaterial changes to the financial market risks described as of January 29, 2023.\\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative\\nDisclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of October 29, 2023, there\\nhave been no material changes to the foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 29, 2023.\\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nControls and Procedures\\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\\nBased on their evaluation as of October  29, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has\\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective to provide\\nreasonable assurance.\\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or\\nERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial\\nrecords used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes\\nthat materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures\\nor our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the\\nfact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations\\nin all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within\\nNVIDIA have been detected.\\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\nRefer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our\\nlegal proceedings since January 29, 2023. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\\nJanuary 29, 2023 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.\\n35\\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\\nOther than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 and Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal\\nquarters ended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023.\\nPurchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, in Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters\\nended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023, and below. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results\\nof operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or\\nthat we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\\nFailure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed\\nwafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of\\ncustomer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and\\ndemand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has\\nsignificantly harmed our financial results.\\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future\\nenter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our\\nbusiness needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles\\nor enter new lines of business, which may require us to integrate new suppliers into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain\\ncomplexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components from third parties that are necessary\\nfor the finished product are not available. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the\\nsemiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously\\nexperienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to\\nsecure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to\\nscale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may\\nnot have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand\\nfor our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,\\nincluding:\\n•\\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\\n•\\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\\n•\\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\\n•\\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\\n•\\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\\n•\\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\\n•\\nnew or unexpected end use cases;\\n•\\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\\n36\\n•\\nbusiness decisions made by third parties;\\n•\\nthe demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX cloud services;\\n•\\nchanges that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\\n•\\nthe demand for our products relating to cryptocurrency mining, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and\\ngenerative AI models; or\\n•\\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.\\nDemand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To\\nmeet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers, and entered into prepaid\\nsupply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into our\\nsupply chain, may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity\\narrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product\\ntransitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our\\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of\\ntransitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data\\nCenter product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify\\nthe challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products,\\ncustomers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product\\nintroductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for\\ncurrent generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same\\ntime for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our\\nfinancial results may be negatively impacted. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges\\nand quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and\\ndelay further production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our\\ntechnologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we\\nhave managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,\\nmay impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\\nOur End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple original equipment manufacturers, original device\\nmanufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple original equipment\\nmanufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market\\nconditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly\\nforecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to\\nincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase\\nproduction levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience\\nsupply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at\\nall, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally,\\nsince some of our products are part of a\\n37\\ncomplex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader\\nrevenue impact.\\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our\\ncompetitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a\\nreduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a\\nresult of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\\nproducts as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also\\nwritten-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-\\ncancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make\\nchanges to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and\\nprepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively\\nimpact our gross margins and financial results.\\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist, such as NVIDIA DGX cloud services,\\nNVIDIA AI Foundations, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new\\nuse cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate\\nsignificant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while\\nthey have driven increased demand for Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be\\nused in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI\\nmodels on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace\\nHopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue\\nor supply levels.\\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead\\ntimes may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical\\ntensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract\\nmanufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and\\ncan in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years\\nago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable\\ndegree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for\\nour products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government\\ncryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has\\nimpacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand\\nfor our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have\\nreduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased\\naftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously\\nintroduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided cryptocurrency mining processors, or\\nCMP, products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Following the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and\\nAda Lovelace GPU architectures no longer include LHR. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the\\nunauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our\\nnew products and distribution channels.\\nAdditionally, we depend on developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications\\nthat leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as\\nGeForce NOW. Failure by\\n38\\ndevelopers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party\\ncontent providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our\\nplatforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business.\\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are\\nmanufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 65% and 62% of our\\nrevenue during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the United States, respectively. Due to recent\\nUSG licensing requirements, we expect that our sales to China and other affected destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter of\\nfiscal year 2024. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in\\nthe future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including domestic and international\\neconomic and political conditions between countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to\\ncontrol case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, domestic\\nand international business and cultural practices that differ, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, and/or currency fluctuations,\\nand natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.\\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages,\\ntelecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military\\nactions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our\\ncorporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located\\nin California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our\\noperations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas.\\nCatastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and\\ndevelopment systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase\\neconomic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries\\nin which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts,\\nincluding but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of\\nour products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and\\noperating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may\\ncontinue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and\\ncompanies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if\\nmanufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power\\nshortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.\\nThe ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is\\nunknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business\\ncould be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume\\noperations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our\\napproximately 3,400 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our\\nnetworking products. Our operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted\\nemployees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact.\\nFurther, in connection with the conflict, a significant number and percentage of our employees have\\n39\\nbeen called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel may be absent for an extended and indeterminate\\nperiod, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we did not experience any\\nsignificant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and\\nrevenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including\\ndue to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and\\nservices and harm our business. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service\\ninterruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on\\naccess to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the\\nability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services.\\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully\\nintegrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.\\nWe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help\\nexpand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our\\nability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we\\npursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If\\nwe are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to\\npursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition\\nless attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our\\nbusiness. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived\\nability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in\\npublicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have\\ninvested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These\\ncompanies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-\\nmarketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in\\nwhich we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio may\\ncontain industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses. We face\\nadditional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s\\nattention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\\ndifficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings\\ninitiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the\\nassets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.\\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\\n•\\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees,\\nincluding key personnel, of the acquired business;\\n•\\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\\n•\\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\\n•\\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\\n40\\n•\\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise\\nunable to close an acquisition;\\n•\\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt\\ncovenants or other restrictions;\\n•\\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\\n•\\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\\n•\\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\\n•\\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\\n•\\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges\\nincluding lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic\\ndata interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration\\npersonnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of\\nsales to End Customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these End\\nCustomers.\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to\\nCustomer A represented 12% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, and sales to Customer B represented 11% of total revenue\\nfor the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, both of which were attributable to the Compute \u0026 Networking segment. With several of these\\nchannel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales\\nwithin our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners\\nmay decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other\\nway. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase\\ncommitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may\\npurchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase\\nour products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Our sales to Customer A and Customer B were largely in\\nsupport of two End Customers. One End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 15% and 17% of total revenue for the third\\nquarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. A second End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 13% and\\n10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of these End Customers were primarily\\nattributable to our Compute \u0026 Networking segment. Our estimated Compute \u0026 Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain\\nconcentrated. Our customers sell to End Customers. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple\\noriginal equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. If end demand\\nincreases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors, and channel partners\\nmay have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large\\ncustomers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade restrictions, or\\nany difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other\\nactions may adversely impact our business.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership\\nand infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business\\nacquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising;\\n41\\nemployment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change;\\ncryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,\\nand may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our\\nemployees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have\\ndesigned to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our\\nemployees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we\\nare subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further\\nrestrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance\\ncosts as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on\\ncybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators\\nworldwide, including the European Union, the United States, and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information\\nfrom us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into\\ncompetition in those markets. We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union and China regarding our\\nsales of GPUs and our efforts to allocate supply, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Revisions to laws or\\nregulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import\\nduties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business\\nplans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or\\nplan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions,\\ndecrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and\\nemployees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government\\nrestricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material\\nadverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S.\\nlaws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could\\nhave a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control\\nmeasures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year\\n2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted End\\nCustomer sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and\\nservices capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and\\nservice offerings.\\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI\\napplications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be\\nused for training, refining, and deploying large language models. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of\\ndownstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy, and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and\\nnegatively impact our business and financial results.\\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI\\ntechnologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are\\nincreasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral\\ncontrols restricting GPUs and associated products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls\\nhave been and may again be very broad in scope and\\n42\\napplication, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could\\nnegatively impact our manufacturing, testing, and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to\\nserve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue, and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs\\nand semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our\\nability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive\\ndisadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated\\nwith AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or\\ntransfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to\\nprovide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to\\nprovide services to their End Customers, even outside China.\\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets\\noutside China and for our gaming products. Even the possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future\\nnegatively impact demand for our products, benefitting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated\\nchanges in the export control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially\\nimpacting our business.\\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services,\\nnegatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us\\nto incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that\\nnegatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional\\nexport restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including\\nChina, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which\\ncould also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and our efforts to supply the China market, and if\\nthey conclude that we have violated any applicable law in China or the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition, this\\ncould subject us to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse\\nimpact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s\\nsemiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and\\ntechnology used to develop, produce, and manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically\\nimpact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The\\nlicensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance\\nthresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of\\nproducts, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal\\nyear 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain\\ncustomers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nOn October 17, 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports\\nto China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding\\nIsrael) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an\\nultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements\\nwere effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products.\\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out\\nof China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and\\nsupply and distribution operations,\\n43\\nas well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new regulation-\\ncompliant solutions, including those for which the USG does not wish to have any advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a\\ncustomer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG\\nwill grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. The USG is evaluating license requests in\\na non-public process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on\\nNVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that\\nare not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.\\nManagement of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and\\nour competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls,\\nincluding further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if\\ncustomers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG\\ndoes not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG\\ngrants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The\\nlicensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support\\nefforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor\\nsuppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control\\nrules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our\\nbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to\\ndevelop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as\\nother impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG is seeking to impose conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to\\ncreate and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or\\nimpair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs,\\nand if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution\\nchain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our\\nsupply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls\\nrestricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our\\nGPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of\\ndownstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely\\nhave a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope\\nof such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted\\nregions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are\\nable to serve markets worldwide. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services\\nnot only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase\\nthe risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new\\nunilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less\\nlikely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our\\nGaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese\\ngovernment may impose restrictions on the sale to certain End Customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our\\npartners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain\\nproducts made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our\\nbusiness and financial results.\\n44\\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new\\nrestrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our\\nbusiness and financial results.\\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm\\nand liability.\\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in reputational or\\nfinancial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our\\nproducts and services, and we also offer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and\\nchallenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived\\nor actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences or are controversial because of their impact on human\\nrights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and\\nframeworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience\\nbrand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could\\nincrease our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain\\nproducts and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with government regulation of AI, including\\nunder proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union as well as under any U.S. regulation adopted in response to\\nthe Biden administration’s Executive Order on AI, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional\\nreporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive Order on AI could require us to notify\\nthe USG of certain safety test results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and\\ndisadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to address\\nconcerns and regulation relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in\\nour products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\\nITEM 2.

Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 29, 2023 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, as filed with the SEC,\nbut does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring\nadjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the\ninterim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in\nconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended January 29, 2023. \nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 29, 2023.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 are both 52-week years. The third\nquarters of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were both 13-week quarters.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going\nbasis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\nreceivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other\ncharges, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions\nthat we believe are reasonable.\nIn February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and\nusage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to a range of four to\nfive years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to seven years. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning\nof fiscal year 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net, in use\nas of the end of fiscal year 2023, the estimated effect of this change for the three months ended October 29, 2023 was a benefit of $17 million\nand $24 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $41 million and\nnet income of $36 million after tax, or $0.01 per both basic and diluted share.

Any anti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net\nincome per share.\nNote 6 – Income Taxes\nIncome tax was an expense of $1.28 billion and $2.24 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and a\nbenefit of $67 million and $61 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of\nincome before income tax was an expense of 12.2% and 11.3% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and a\nbenefit of 10.9% and 2.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2018\nand 2019 was resolved. We recognized a non-cash net benefit of $145  million, related to this IRS audit resolution, for effectively settled\npositions. This benefit consists of a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of\nfederal benefit partially offset by additional cash tax payments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.\nThe effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based\ncompensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax\nrate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.\nOur effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax\nbenefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our effective\ntax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the IRS audit resolution.\n12\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nOther than the IRS audit resolution, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, there were no material changes to our tax years that remain\nsubject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. Additionally, there have been no other material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and\nany related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023.\nWhile we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not\nthat the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.\nAccordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are\nmade or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of October 29, 2023, we do not believe\nthat our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\nNote 7 - Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities \nOur cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities are classified as “available-for-sale” debt securities.\nThe following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities:\n \nOctober 29, 2023\nAmortized\nCost\nUnrealized\nGain\nUnrealized\nLoss\nEstimated\nFair Value\nReported as\n \nCash\nEquivalents\nMarketable\nSecurities\n \n(In millions)\nCorporate debt securities\n$\n6,937 \n$\n1 \n$\n(20)\n$\n6,918 \n$\n1,714 \n$\n5,204 \nDebt securities issued by the U.S.\nTreasury\n5,075 \n1 \n(24)\n5,052 \n— \n5,052 \nMoney market funds\n3,190 \n— \n— \n3,190 \n3,190 \n— \nDebt securities issued by U.S.\ngovernment agencies\n2,316 \n— \n(5)\n2,311 \n100 \n2,211 \nCertificates of deposit\n418 \n— \n— \n418 \n198 \n220 \nForeign government bonds\n175 \n— \n— \n175 \n100 \n75 \nTotal\n$\n18,111 \n$\n2 \n$\n(49)\n$\n18,064 \n$\n5,302 \n$\n12,762 \n \nJanuary 29, 2023\nAmortized\nCost\nUnrealized\nGain\nUnrealized\nLoss\nEstimated\nFair Value\nReported as\n \nCash\nEquivalents\nMarketable\nSecurities\n \n(In millions)\nCorporate debt securities\n$\n4,809 \n$\n— \n$\n(12)\n$\n4,797 \n$\n1,087 \n$\n3,710 \nDebt securities issued by the U.S.\nTreasury\n4,185 \n1 \n(44)\n4,142 \n— \n4,142 \nDebt securities issued by U.S.\ngovernment agencies\n1,836 \n— \n(2)\n1,834 \n50 \n1,784 \nMoney market funds\n1,777 \n— \n— \n1,777 \n1,777 \n— \nCertificates of deposit\n365 \n— \n— \n365 \n134 \n231 \nForeign government bonds\n140 \n— \n— \n140 \n100 \n40 \nTotal\n$\n13,112 \n$\n1 \n$\n(58)\n$\n13,055 \n$\n3,148 \n$\n9,907 \n13\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following tables provide the breakdown of unrealized losses, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities\nhave been in a continuous loss position:\nOctober 29, 2023\n \nLess than 12 Months\n12 Months or Greater\nTotal\n \nEstimated Fair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLoss\nEstimated Fair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLoss\nEstimated Fair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLoss\n \n(In millions)\nCorporate debt securities\n$\n2,773 \n$\n(16)\n$\n852 \n$\n(4)\n$\n3,625  $\n(20)\nDebt securities issued by the U.S.\nTreasury\n2,098 \n(12)\n1,371 \n(12)\n3,469 \n(24)\nDebt securities issued by U.S.\ngovernment agencies\n1,447 \n(5)\n— \n— \n1,447 \n(5)\nTotal\n$\n6,318 \n$\n(33)\n$\n2,223 \n$\n(16)\n$\n8,541  $\n(49)\nJanuary 29, 2023\n \nLess than 12 Months\n12 Months or Greater\nTotal\n \nEstimated Fair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLoss\nEstimated Fair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLoss\nEstimated Fair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLoss\n \n(In millions)\nDebt securities issued by the U.S.\nTreasury\n$\n2,444 \n$\n(21)\n$\n1,172 \n$\n(23)\n$\n3,616  $\n(44)\nCorporate debt securities\n1,188 \n(7)\n696 \n(5)\n1,884 \n(12)\nDebt securities issued by U.S.\ngovernment agencies\n1,307 \n(2)\n— \n— \n1,307 \n(2)\nTotal\n$\n4,939 \n$\n(30)\n$\n1,868 \n$\n(28)\n$\n6,807  $\n(58)\nThe gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, driven primarily by changes in interest rates.

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also\nalleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class\ncertification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert\nfees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from\njudgment\n20\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nin the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit\npanel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district\ncourt did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth\nCircuit panel’s majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023.\nThe putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG,\ninitially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the\nplaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case,\nbut stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. Following the\nNinth Circuit’s denial of NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the parties will meet and confer regarding the next steps in this\nderivative matter. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of\nfiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the\ndissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU\ndemand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance\nand internal procedures.\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,\nLipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending\nresolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. Following the Ninth Circuit’s denial of NVIDIA’s\npetition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the parties will meet and confer regarding the next steps in these derivative matters. The lawsuits\nassert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,\ninsider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on\nthe dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU\ndemand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and\nunspecified corporate governance measures.\nAnother putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang,\net al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the\nCompany for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to\nchannel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including\ndisgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures.\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\nAs of October 29, 2023, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based\non our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in\nthese matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.\nNote 14 - Shareholders’ Equity \nCapital Return Program \nDuring the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 8.3 million and 15.9 million shares of our common stock for\n$3.72 billion and $7.01 billion, respectively. During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we repurchased 28 million and\n56 million shares of our common stock for\n21\nNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n$3.65 billion and $8.99 billion, respectively. In August 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an\nadditional $25.00  billion, without expiration. As of October  29, 2023, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase\nadditional shares of our common stock up to $25.24 billion. From October 30, 2023 through November 17, 2023, we repurchased 0.8 million\nshares for $366 million pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to\nemployees. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.\nDuring the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we paid $99 million and $296 million in cash dividends to our shareholders,\nrespectively. During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we paid $100 million and $300 million in cash dividends to our\nshareholders, respectively. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board of\nDirectors&#039; continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our\nshareholders.\nNote 15 - Segment Information\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on\nan operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance.\nThe Compute &amp; Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platform; networking; automotive artificial intelligence, or\nAI, Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; electric vehicle computing platforms; Jetson for\nrobotics and other embedded platforms; NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software; and DGX Cloud.\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and\nsolutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; virtual GPU software for cloud-based visual and\nvirtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating 3D internet\napplications.\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged\nacross our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.\nThe “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute &amp; Networking or Graphics for purposes of\nmaking operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate\ninfrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and other costs, intellectual property related, or IP-related costs, acquisition termination cost,\nand other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense\ndirectly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, our CODM does not evaluate\ndepreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue.\nThe accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements.

All rights reserved.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set\nforth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, and our Quarterly\nReports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023 under the heading “Risk Factors” of such reports, and our\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere\nin this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, before deciding to purchase or sell shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nSince our founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 has sparked the growth of\nthe PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and has fueled industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA\nis now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.\nOur two operating segments are \&quot;Compute &amp; Networking\&quot; and \&quot;Graphics,\&quot; as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nDemand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To\nmeet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers and entered into prepaid\nsupply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into our\nsupply chain may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity\narrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\n25\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity\ncommitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand\nexpectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles or enter new lines of business, which may\nrequire us to integrate new suppliers into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity.\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the\narchitecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch\ncadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges\nassociated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers\nanticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can\ncreate reductions or volatility in our revenue. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and\nquality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay\nfurther production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our\ntechnologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we\nhave managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,\nmay impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist such as our Omniverse platform, third-\nparty large language models, and generative AI models. We have recently begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX cloud services\ndirectly and through our network of partners, which includes cloud-based infrastructure and software and services for training and deploying AI\nmodels, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for customizable pretrained AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services\ncan be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use\ncases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand\nfor Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown.\nGlobal Trade\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions,\nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or\nboards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100\nproducts destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nOn October 17, 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports\nto China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding\nIsrael) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an\nultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements\nwere effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. These licensing requirements did not have a\nmeaningful impact on our revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 as they were announced near the end of the fiscal quarter and we had\nadditional demand from customers outside of the named country groups. Our sales to China and other affected destinations, derived from\nproducts that are now subject to licensing requirements, have consistently contributed approximately 20-25% of Data Center revenue over the\npast few quarters. We expect that our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, though we\nbelieve the decline will be more than offset by strong growth in other regions.\nWe are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new regulation-compliant solutions, including those for which the USG does\nnot wish to have any advance notice before each shipment. To the\n26\nextent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance\nthat the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed over the long-term, if there are\nfurther changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has\nchanged and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and\nlicensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our\ninventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding\nus from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. Our sales to China will decrease\nsignificantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific, including\nChina, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative\nmanufacturing locations and negatively impact our business.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic\nand geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While\ndifficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs\nfor capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing strategy generally does not fluctuate with short-term\nchanges in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors. \nIsrael\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our\napproximately 3,400 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our\nnetworking products. Our operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted\nemployees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact.\nFurther, in connection with the conflict, a significant number and percentage of our employees have been called-up for active military duty in\nIsrael. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel may be absent for an extended and indeterminate period, which may cause disruption to our\nproduct development or operations. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we did not experience any significant impact or expense to our\nbusiness; however, if the conflict is extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for\nour business.\nThird Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Summary\nThree Months Ended\n \nOctober 29,\n2023\nJuly 30, 2023\nOctober 30,\n2022\nQuarter-over-Quarter\nChange\nYear-over-Year\nChange\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nRevenue\n$\n18,120 \n$\n13,507 \n$\n5,931 \n34 %\n206 %\nGross margin\n74.0 %\n70.1 %\n53.6 %\n3.9 pts\n20.4 pts\nOperating expenses\n$\n2,983 \n$\n2,662 \n$\n2,576 \n12 %\n16 %\nOperating income\n$\n10,417 \n$\n6,800 \n$\n601 \n53 %\n1,633 %\nNet income\n$\n9,243 \n$\n6,188 \n$\n680 \n49 %\n1,259 %\nNet income per diluted share\n$\n3.71 \n$\n2.48 \n$\n0.27 \n50 %\n1,274 %\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate\nprocessors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and\n27\nservices to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional\nVisualization, and Automotive.\nRevenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $18.12 billion, up 206% from a year ago and up 34% sequentially.\nData Center revenue was up 279% from a year ago and up 41% sequentially. Strong sales of the NVIDIA HGX platform were driven by global\ndemand for the training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Data Center\ncompute grew 324% from a year ago and 38% sequentially, largely reflecting the strong ramp of our Hopper GPU architecture-based HGX\nplatform from cloud service providers, or CSPs, including GPU-specialized CSPs; consumer internet companies; and enterprises. Our sales of\nAmpere GPU architecture-based Data Center products were significant but declined sequentially, as we approach the tail end of this\narchitecture. We recognized initial revenue on the ramp of our L40S GPU and the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip for a broad range of\ncustomers. CSPs drove roughly half of Data Center revenue, while consumer internet companies and enterprises comprised approximately the\nother half. Networking was up 155% from a year ago and up 52% sequentially, almost entirely due to strong growth in InfiniBand infrastructure to\nsupport our HGX platform.\nGaming revenue was up 81% from a year ago and up 15% sequentially. Strong year-on-year growth reflects higher sell-in to partners following\nnormalization of channel inventory levels. Sequential growth reflects strong demand for our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for back-to-school\nand the start of the holiday season.\nProfessional Visualization revenue was up 108% from a year ago and up 10% sequentially. The year-on-year increase reflects higher sell-in to\npartners following normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was primarily due to stronger enterprise workstation\ndemand and the ramp of notebook workstations based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture.\nAutomotive revenue was up 4% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects growth in sales of auto\ncockpit solutions and self-driving platforms. The sequential increase was driven by sales of self-driving platforms.\nGross margin increased significantly from a year ago and sequentially, driven by improved product mix from Data Center revenue growth and\nlower net inventory provisions and related charges.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, provisions for inventory and related charges were $681 million. Sales of previously reserved inventory or\nsettlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $239 million, primarily from Ampere GPU architecture\nproducts. The net inventory provisions were $442 million and the unfavorable effect on our gross margin was 2.4 percentage points.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, provisions for inventory and related charges were $702 million. Sales of previously reserved inventory or\nsettlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $21 million. The net inventory provisions were $681\nmillion and the unfavorable effect on our gross margin was 11.5 percentage points.\nOperating expenses were up 16% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially, driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based\ncompensation, primarily reflecting growth in employees and compensation increases.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $14.51 billion, up 279% from a year ago and up 41% from the previous quarter.\nWe announced NVIDIA HGX H200 with the H200 Tensor Core GPU; introduced an AI foundry service, first available on Microsoft Azure;\nannounced that the NVIDIA Spectrum-X will be integrated into servers from Dell Technologies, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Lenovo in the\nfirst quarter of next year; announced that NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips will power more than 40 new supercomputers and began\nshipping in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024; and partnered with a range of leading companies on AI initiatives, including Amdocs, Dropbox,\nFoxconn, Genentech (member of Roche Group), Infosys, Lenovo, Reliance Industries, Scaleway, and Tata Group.\nGaming revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $2.86 billion, up 81% from a year ago and up 15% from the previous quarter. We\nlaunched DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction; released TensorRT-LLM for Windows; added 56 DLSS games and over 15 Reflex games; and\nsurpassed 1,700 games on GeForce NOW.\n28\nProfessional Visualization revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $416 million, up 108% from a year ago and up 10% from the\nprevious quarter. We announced a new line of desktop workstations with NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPUs and NVIDIA ConnectX smart\ninterface cards.\nAutomotive revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $261 million, up 4% from a year ago and up 3% from the previous quarter.

Compute GPUs grew 369% year-on-year and 193% compared to the first\nnine months of fiscal year 2023 led by strong demand for the NVIDIA HGX platform driven by global demand for the training and inferencing of\nlarge language models, recommendation engines and inferencing of generative AI applications. Networking was up 155% year-on-year and 99%\ncompared to the first nine months of last year, almost entirely due to strong growth in InfiniBand infrastructure to support our HGX platform.\nGraphics - The increase in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflects growth in Gaming GPUs\nreflecting higher sell-in to partners following normalization of channel inventory levels earlier this year. The decrease in the first nine months of\nfiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 primarily reflects 57% lower enterprise graphics and 14% lower\nProfessional Visualization GPUs, partially offset by 7% growth in Gaming GPUs, following normalization of channel inventory levels earlier this\nyear.\nConcentration of Revenue \nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, or End\nCustomers, such as CSPs, enterprises, and gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States\naccounted for 65% and 62% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and 64% and 71% of\ntotal revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively.\nOur customers include original equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system builders, system integrators, add-in board\nmanufacturers, retailers/distributors, automotive manufacturers, tier-1 automotive suppliers, and other enterprises.\nSales to Customer A represented 12% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, and sales to Customer B represented 11% of total\nrevenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, both of which were attributable to the Compute &amp; Networking segment.\nOur customers sell to End Customers. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple original\nequipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. Our sales to Customer A\nand Customer B were largely in support of two End Customers. One End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 15% and\n17% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. A second End Customer is estimated to have\nrepresented approximately 13% and 10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of\nthese End Customers were primarily attributable to our Compute &amp; Networking segment.\nOur estimated Compute &amp; Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain concentrated.\nIn the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, there were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023,\none customer represented 10% of total revenue, primarily attributable to the Compute &amp; Networking segment.\nGross Margin\nOur overall gross margin increased to 74.0% and 70.9% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, from 53.6%\nand 55.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023,\n30\nrespectively. The year over year increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024 was primarily due to improved product mix\nfrom Data Center revenue growth of 279% and 156%, respectively, and lower net inventory provisions and related charges.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $681 million and $1.39 billion for the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted\nin a provision release of $239 million and $372 million, primarily from Ampere GPU architecture products, for the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of fiscal year 2024, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.4% and 2.6% in the third quarter and\nfirst nine months of fiscal year 2024.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $702 million and $2.01 billion for the third quarter and first nine\nmonths of fiscal year 2023, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted\nin a provision release of $21 million and $59 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively.

Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and\ncredit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.\nCash provided by operating activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023,\ndue to growth in revenue, partially offset by higher accounts receivable balance and taxes paid. Accounts receivable balance in the third quarter\nof fiscal year 2024 reflected approximately $570 million from customer payments received ahead of the invoice due date.\nCash provided by investing activities decreased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023,\nprimarily driven by lower marketable securities maturities.\nCash used in financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, due\nto a debt repayment in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and higher tax payments related to RSUs, partially offset by lower share\nrepurchases.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of\nOctober  29, 2023, we had $18.28 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt\nsecurities issued by the USG and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as\ncertificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to\nNote 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to\nmeet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our debt obligations, future supply\nobligations and vendor and supplier prepayments. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external\ncapital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\nExcept for approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued\nany related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities held outside of the U.S. as of October 29, 2023 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\nWe\n33\npaid $4.35 billion in cash taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, largely for previously deferred federal income tax payments related to the\ndisaster relief made available by the IRS for certain California taxpayers.\nCapital Return to Shareholders\nDuring the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we returned $3.72 billion and $7.01 billion, respectively, in share repurchases\nand $99 million and $296 million, respectively, in cash dividends.\nOur cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to the continuing determination by our\nBoard of Directors that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.\nOn August 21, 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.00 billion, without\nexpiration. As of October 29, 2023, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock\nup to $25.24 billion. From October 30, 2023 through November 17, 2023, we repurchased 0.8 million shares for $366 million pursuant to a Rule\n10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share\nrepurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee\ncompensation made after December 31, 2022. This provision has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of October 29, 2023, by year payable, are as follows:\n \nOctober 29, 2023\n \n(In millions)\nDue in one year\n$\n1,250 \nDue in one to five years\n2,250 \nDue in five to ten years\n2,750 \nDue in greater than ten years\n3,500 \nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs\n(44)\nNet carrying amount\n9,706 \nLess short-term portion\n(1,249)\nTotal long-term portion\n$\n8,457 \nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of October 29, 2023, we had not issued any\ncommercial paper.\nMaterial Cash Requirements and Other Obligations\nWe have unrecognized tax benefits of $1.10 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $115 million recorded in non-current income\ntax payable as of October 29, 2023. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties\nin individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.\nRefer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nOther than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our\ncontractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. Refer to Item 7,\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our\noperating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations, refer to Note 3, Note 12, and Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements, respectively.\n34\nClimate Change\nTo date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from\nsourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends.\nAdoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThere has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nFinancial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nAbout Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of October 29, 2023, there have been no\nmaterial changes to the financial market risks described as of January 29, 2023.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of October 29, 2023, there\nhave been no material changes to the foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 29, 2023.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on their evaluation as of October  29, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective to provide\nreasonable assurance.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or\nERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial\nrecords used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes\nthat materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures\nor our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the\nfact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations\nin all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within\nNVIDIA have been detected.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nRefer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our\nlegal proceedings since January 29, 2023. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 29, 2023 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.\n35\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOther than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 and Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal\nquarters ended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023.\nPurchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, in Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters\nended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023, and below. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results\nof operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or\nthat we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nFailure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed\nwafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of\ncustomer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and\ndemand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has\nsignificantly harmed our financial results.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future\nenter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our\nbusiness needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles\nor enter new lines of business, which may require us to integrate new suppliers into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain\ncomplexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components from third parties that are necessary\nfor the finished product are not available. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the\nsemiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously\nexperienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to\nsecure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to\nscale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may\nnot have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand\nfor our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,\nincluding:\n•\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\n•\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\n•\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\n•\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\n•\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n•\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n•\nnew or unexpected end use cases;\n•\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\n36\n•\nbusiness decisions made by third parties;\n•\nthe demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX cloud services;\n•\nchanges that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\n•\nthe demand for our products relating to cryptocurrency mining, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and\ngenerative AI models; or\n•\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.\nDemand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To\nmeet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers, and entered into prepaid\nsupply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into our\nsupply chain, may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity\narrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product\ntransitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of\ntransitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data\nCenter product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify\nthe challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products,\ncustomers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product\nintroductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for\ncurrent generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same\ntime for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our\nfinancial results may be negatively impacted. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges\nand quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and\ndelay further production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our\ntechnologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we\nhave managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,\nmay impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nOur End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple original equipment manufacturers, original device\nmanufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple original equipment\nmanufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market\nconditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly\nforecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\nIf we underestimate our customers&#039; future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to\nincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase\nproduction levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience\nsupply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at\nall, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally,\nsince some of our products are part of a\n37\ncomplex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader\nrevenue impact.\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our\ncompetitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a\nreduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a\nresult of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\nproducts as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also\nwritten-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-\ncancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make\nchanges to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and\nprepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively\nimpact our gross margins and financial results.\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist, such as NVIDIA DGX cloud services,\nNVIDIA AI Foundations, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new\nuse cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate\nsignificant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while\nthey have driven increased demand for Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be\nused in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI\nmodels on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace\nHopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue\nor supply levels.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead\ntimes may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical\ntensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract\nmanufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and\ncan in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years\nago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable\ndegree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for\nour products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government\ncryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has\nimpacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand\nfor our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have\nreduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased\naftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously\nintroduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided cryptocurrency mining processors, or\nCMP, products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Following the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and\nAda Lovelace GPU architectures no longer include LHR. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the\nunauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our\nnew products and distribution channels.\nAdditionally, we depend on developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications\nthat leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as\nGeForce NOW. Failure by\n38\ndevelopers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party\ncontent providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our\nplatforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business.\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are\nmanufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 65% and 62% of our\nrevenue during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the United States, respectively. Due to recent\nUSG licensing requirements, we expect that our sales to China and other affected destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter of\nfiscal year 2024. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in\nthe future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including domestic and international\neconomic and political conditions between countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to\ncontrol case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, domestic\nand international business and cultural practices that differ, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, and/or currency fluctuations,\nand natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages,\ntelecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military\nactions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our\ncorporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located\nin California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our\noperations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas.\nCatastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and\ndevelopment systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase\neconomic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries\nin which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts,\nincluding but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of\nour products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and\noperating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may\ncontinue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and\ncompanies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if\nmanufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power\nshortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.\nThe ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is\nunknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business\ncould be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume\noperations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our\napproximately 3,400 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our\nnetworking products. Our operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted\nemployees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact.\nFurther, in connection with the conflict, a significant number and percentage of our employees have\n39\nbeen called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel may be absent for an extended and indeterminate\nperiod, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we did not experience any\nsignificant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and\nrevenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including\ndue to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and\nservices and harm our business. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service\ninterruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on\naccess to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the\nability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully\nintegrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.\nWe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help\nexpand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our\nability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we\npursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If\nwe are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to\npursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition\nless attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our\nbusiness. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived\nability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in\npublicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have\ninvested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These\ncompanies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are non-\nmarketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in\nwhich we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio may\ncontain industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses. We face\nadditional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s\nattention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\ndifficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings\ninitiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the\nassets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n•\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees,\nincluding key personnel, of the acquired business;\n•\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n•\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n•\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n40\n•\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise\nunable to close an acquisition;\n•\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt\ncovenants or other restrictions;\n•\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n•\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n•\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\n•\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\n•\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges\nincluding lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic\ndata interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration\npersonnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of\nsales to End Customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these End\nCustomers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to\nCustomer A represented 12% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, and sales to Customer B represented 11% of total revenue\nfor the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, both of which were attributable to the Compute &amp; Networking segment. With several of these\nchannel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales\nwithin our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners\nmay decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other\nway. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase\ncommitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may\npurchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase\nour products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Our sales to Customer A and Customer B were largely in\nsupport of two End Customers. One End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 15% and 17% of total revenue for the third\nquarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. A second End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 13% and\n10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of these End Customers were primarily\nattributable to our Compute &amp; Networking segment. Our estimated Compute &amp; Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain\nconcentrated. Our customers sell to End Customers. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple\noriginal equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. If end demand\nincreases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors, and channel partners\nmay have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large\ncustomers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade restrictions, or\nany difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other\nactions may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership\nand infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business\nacquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising;\n41\nemployment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change;\ncryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,\nand may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our\nemployees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have\ndesigned to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our\nemployees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we\nare subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further\nrestrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance\ncosts as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on\ncybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators\nworldwide, including the European Union, the United States, and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information\nfrom us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into\ncompetition in those markets. We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union and China regarding our\nsales of GPUs and our efforts to allocate supply, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Revisions to laws or\nregulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import\nduties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business\nplans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or\nplan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions,\ndecrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and\nemployees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government\nrestricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material\nadverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S.\nlaws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could\nhave a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control\nmeasures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year\n2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted End\nCustomer sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and\nservices capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and\nservice offerings.\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI\napplications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be\nused for training, refining, and deploying large language models. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of\ndownstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy, and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and\nnegatively impact our business and financial results.\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI\ntechnologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are\nincreasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral\ncontrols restricting GPUs and associated products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls\nhave been and may again be very broad in scope and\n42\napplication, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could\nnegatively impact our manufacturing, testing, and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to\nserve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue, and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs\nand semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our\nability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive\ndisadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated\nwith AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or\ntransfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to\nprovide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to\nprovide services to their End Customers, even outside China.\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets\noutside China and for our gaming products. Even the possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future\nnegatively impact demand for our products, benefitting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated\nchanges in the export control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially\nimpacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services,\nnegatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us\nto incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that\nnegatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional\nexport restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including\nChina, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which\ncould also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and our efforts to supply the China market, and if\nthey conclude that we have violated any applicable law in China or the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition, this\ncould subject us to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse\nimpact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s\nsemiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and\ntechnology used to develop, produce, and manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically\nimpact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance\nthresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of\nproducts, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal\nyear 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain\ncustomers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nOn October 17, 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports\nto China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding\nIsrael) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an\nultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements\nwere effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products.\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out\nof China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and\nsupply and distribution operations,\n43\nas well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new regulation-\ncompliant solutions, including those for which the USG does not wish to have any advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a\ncustomer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG\nwill grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. The USG is evaluating license requests in\na non-public process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on\nNVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that\nare not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.\nManagement of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and\nour competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls,\nincluding further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if\ncustomers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG\ndoes not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG\ngrants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The\nlicensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support\nefforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor\nsuppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control\nrules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our\nbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to\ndevelop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as\nother impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG is seeking to impose conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to\ncreate and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or\nimpair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs,\nand if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution\nchain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our\nsupply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls\nrestricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our\nGPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of\ndownstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely\nhave a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope\nof such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted\nregions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are\nable to serve markets worldwide. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services\nnot only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase\nthe risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new\nunilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less\nlikely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our\nGaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese\ngovernment may impose restrictions on the sale to certain End Customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our\npartners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain\nproducts made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our\nbusiness and financial results.\n44\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new\nrestrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our\nbusiness and financial results.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm\nand liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in reputational or\nfinancial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our\nproducts and services, and we also offer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and\nchallenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived\nor actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences or are controversial because of their impact on human\nrights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and\nframeworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience\nbrand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could\nincrease our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain\nproducts and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with government regulation of AI, including\nunder proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union as well as under any U.S. regulation adopted in response to\nthe Biden administration’s Executive Order on AI, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional\nreporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive Order on AI could require us to notify\nthe USG of certain safety test results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and\ndisadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to address\nconcerns and regulation relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in\nour products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, USE OF PROCEEDS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nDuring the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 8.3 million and 15.9 million shares of our common stock for\n$3.72 billion and $7.01 billion, respectively. On August 21, 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program\nof an additional $25.00 billion, without expiration.
